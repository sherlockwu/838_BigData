<n>In</n> the distant future, since the <n>Earth</n> has become <n>overpopulated</n>, efforts to find and colonize on other <n>planets</n> have begun. <n>However</n>, one of the <n>ships</n>, the "<n>Mesopotamia</n>" <n>malfunctions</n> and all but 6 of its <n>inhabitants</n> are all killed. the remaining 6 manage to escape to a nearby <n>planet</n> named "<n>Terra ll</n> ", which is similar to <n>Earth</n> in many respects. <n>However</n>, all of them are male. <n>Therefore</n>, as to not let their <n>efforts</n> go to waste, they begin to set up 6 <n>countries</n> and to reproduce through cloning and genetic <n>engineering</n>. however, there are still no women, and to make up for it they create lifelike advanced female <n>androids</n> called "<n>Marionettes</n>" which do everyday <n>chores</n> and work. <n>However</n>, they are all emotionless <n>machines</n>. <n>But</n> one day, a ordinary boy named <p>Otaru</p> finds and awakens 3 special battle type <n>Marionettes</n> that have emotions due to a "<n>Maiden Circuit</n>" within them. <n>It's</n> up to him then to teach them and allow their <n>emotions</n> to grow, and when a nearby country threatens with world <n>domination</n>, it's up to to <p>Otaru</p> and his "human" <n>Marionettes</n> to protect their country.
