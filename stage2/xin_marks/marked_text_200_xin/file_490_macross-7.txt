35 years have passed since <p>Lynn Minmay</p> had brought peace between the <n>Zentradi</n> and the <n>humans</n> in the events of <n>Macross</n>. <p>Nekki Basara</n> is a <n>guitarist</n> and a <n>singer</n> of the band <n>Fire Bomber</n>. <n>Living</n> in a <n>less-developed</n> part of the flying <n>colony</n> <n>City</n> 7 which is looking for a habitable <n>planet</n>, he composes and sings songs in the <n>belief</n> that <n>music</n> holds a greater <n>power</n>.

<n>During</n> its <n>flight</n>, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon <n>City 7</n>. <n>However</n>, its attacks are not <n>conventional</n> -- instead of trying to destroy them, they steal what is known as "<n>spiritia</n>", rendering victims unresponsive and <n>zombie-like</n>. <n>During</n> these battles, <p>Basara</p> always goes out into the middle of the <n>warzone</n>, singing his songs and expecting friend and foe to listen and be moved by his <n>music</n>.
