<n>Fifteen</n> years ago, <p>Daiichi Yachiyo Maru</p>, a cargo <n>ship</n>, crashed into a large <n>iceberg</n> in northern <n>Pacific Ocean</n>, and sank, along with the <n>captain</n> and <n>crew</n>.

<n>Now</n>, in <n>Nishitama</n>, a <n>ship</n> designer of <n>Yatsushiro Shipbuilder</n>, which belonged to <n>Yatsushiro Financial Combine</n>, suffered from a sudden heart <n>attack</n> while he was driving, and died in a traffic <n>accident</n>.

<n>Six</n> <n>months</n> have passed since then. <p>Conan</p>, <p>Ran</p>, and <p>Kogoro</p> are enjoying their <p>trip</p> in the <p>Aphrodite</p>. <p>The Aphrodite</p> is a luxury <n>liner</n>, which is sailing for the <n>Pacific Ocean</n> as its maiden <n>voyage</n>. <n>However</n>, there is a suspicious <n>person</n>, and finally a <n>murder</n> occurs.

<n>It's</n> the beginning of a horrible plot occurring in the ocean, where there is <n>no place</n> to escape.
