<p>Golgo 13</p> is not his real name. <n>Then</n> again, neither is <p>Duke Togo</p>, <p>Tadashi Togo</p>, or any number of the <n>aliases</n> he goes by. <n>A</n> man of <n>mystery</n>, not even the world’s most prominent <n>intelligence agencies</n> can determine who <p>Golgo</p> really is, or just where he came from. <n>But</n> all agree that his <n>skills</n> are nothing short of <n>legendary</n>.

<n>Armed</n> with a custom <n>M16</n>, <p>Golgo</n> is willing to take any job for any <n>agency</n>, from the <n>FBI</n> to the <n>KGB</n>. <n>He</n> has completed every <n>contract</n> he has ever taken and will work for anyone who can meet his <n>price</n>. <n>He</n> is both the greatest <n>weapon</n> and the greatest <n>threat</n> to any nation; no one is safe once they are in <p>Golgo</p>’s sights.
