<n>After</n> keeping their <n>BitBeasts</n> out of harm's way, a new world championship tournament is announced, but the defending champions can't all be on the same team. <n>Their</n> friendship will be tested and tried as each <n>Bladebreaker</n> goes on a quest to prove why they are the best <n>Beyblader</n> around. <p>Tyson</p>, <p>Max</p>, <p>Ray</p>, <p>Kai</p>, and newcomer <p>Daichi</p>, must keep up their winning ways...even if they must face each other. <n>But</n>, after the tournament is over, what awaits them is an old foe, <p>Boris</p>, taking over the <n>BBA</n> and transforming it into <n>BEGA</n>, the <n>Beyblade</n> <n>Entertainment</n> <n>Global</n> <n>Association</n>. <n>To</n> save <n>Beybladers</n> of the entire world from <n>BEGA's</n> corruption, the <n>Bladebreakers</n> must reunite once again...
