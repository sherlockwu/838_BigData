<n>The</n> <n>characters</n> from previous .hack//<n>G.U. Games</n> and .hack//<n>Roots</n> receive an email from <p>Ovan</p>. <n>He</n> is requesting them to go to <n>Hidden Forbidden Festival</n> where is set up a mysterious summer festival. <n>There</n> they find an <n>AIDA Chim Chim</n> who wishes to peacefully <n>co-exist</n> with the other players of <n>The World</n>. <n>It</n> then transforms into the word "<n>Returner</n>", so they assume it to mean that <p>Ovan</p> will return to <n>The World</n>.
