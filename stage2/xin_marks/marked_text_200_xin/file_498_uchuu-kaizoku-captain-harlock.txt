<n>It</n> is <n>2977 AD</n> and mankind has become <n>stagnant</n>. <n>Robots</n> do all the work, the <n>masses</n> are kept <n>tranquil<n> by subliminal messages, and <n>government officials</n> are lazy, caring only about recreational activities like <n>golf</n> and <n>horse racing</n>. <p>Captain Harlock</p> has defied this insipid mentality, leading a group of <n>like-minded</n> rebels to a more <n>adventurous</n> life aboard the spaceship <n>Arcadia</n>.
 
<n>A</n> mysterious force known as the <n>Mazone</n> has invaded the <n>Earth</n>, taking the form of mysterious <n>cloaked women</n> that kill anyone who suspect their <n>nefarious doings</n>, such as <p>Tadashi Daiba</p> who is now on their <n>hit-list</n>. <n>After</n> his scientist father is ignored by the government and killed by the <n>Mazone</n>, he joins <p>Captain Harlock</p> and his ragtag group of <n>pirates</n> to assist them as they try to save <n>humanity</n> from the impending alien threat.
