<p>Hatsuki</p> is a highschool <n>student</n> living with her sister, <p>Hatsumi</p>, who she has a huge crush on. On <p>Hatsumi</p>'s 16th birthday, she is suddenly surrounded by a green <n>light</n> and disappears in front of <p>Hatsuki</p>. <n>She</n> manages to follow <p>Hatsumi</p> with the help of a being resembling a fat <n>baby chick</n> (literally), ending up in a place called "<n>The Great Library</n>", which is full of different worlds stored in <n>books</n>. <p>Hatsumi</p> wasn't there, though, so the search for <n>Hatsuki</p>'s great love begins and involves traveling from <n>book</n> to book.
