<n>Six</n> years ago at the magic <n>school</n> known as the <n>Tower of Fang</n>, a grave accident happened involving the magical sword <n>Baltanders</n> and the magic user <p>Azali</p>. <n>Unable</n> to control the sword's <n>power</n>, <p>Azali</p> was transformed into the shape of a great <n>dragon</n> who since that day became known as <n>Bloody August</n>. <p>Krilancelo</p>, a young <n>magician</n> at the <n>Tower</n> who cared greatly for <p>Azali</p> found much to his disgust that the <n>elders</n> of the <n>Tower of Fang</n> were less than willing to save <p>Azali</p> and wanted rather to pretend the <n>accident</n> never happened. Angered by their stand, <p>Krilanceloa</p> swore that he would find a way to return <p>Azali</p> to her <n>former self</n>. <n>Thus</n> he forsook the name <p>Krilancelo</p> and declared himself <n>Orphen</n>, leaving the <n>Tower</n> and his magical <n>studies</n> behind to wander the <n>world</n>...
