<n>Several</n> generations after the original <n>Yatterman</n> series, <p>Leopard</p> lives with her mother and guardians, <p>Dorothy</p>, <p>Voltkatze</p>, and <p>Elephantus</p>, just outside the prosperous <n>Yatter Kingdom</n>. <n>She</n> lives a happy if impoverished life, unaware of her ancestral ties to the infamous <p>Doronbow Gang</p>, until she discovers a mural of <p>Doronjo</p>, <p>Boyacky</p>, and <p>Tonzura</p> in a sealed off area of her home. <n>It</n> turns out that Dorothy, Voltkatze, and Elephantus are descendants of the villainous gangsters, which is why they have been forbidden from entering the hero Yatterman's Kingdom!

At first, Leopard vows to never engage in villainous actions like her ancestors, but new circumstances may mean that she must go back on her word, donning the identity of villain in search of true justice.
