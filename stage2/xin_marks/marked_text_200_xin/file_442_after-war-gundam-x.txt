<n>When</n> one space <n>colony</n> declared its <n>independence</n> from the <n>Earth Federation</n>, the devastating 7th <n>Space War</n>, an <n>all-out</n> war between <n>Earth</n> and space, resulted. <n>The</n> <n>Federation</n> responded to the <n>Space Revolutionary Army</n> with <n>mobile suits</n>, called <n>Gundams</n>. However, the <n>Space Revolutionary</n> forces played their trump <n>card</n> and dropped hundreds of space <n>colonies</n> onto the <n>Earth</n>, plunging the planet into a seven-year-long <n>nuclear winter</n>. <n>The Federation</n> collapsed, but the <n>Space Revolutionary Army</n> was unable to invade the <n>Earth</n> in the aftermath of the colony drop. <n>Fifteen</n> years have passed. <n>The</n> year is now <n>After</n> <n>War</n> 0015, and a <n>New Federation</n> has sprung up on <n>Earth</n> to restore order. <n>In</n> space, the colonial <n>leaders</n> have been rebuilding their own <n>forces</n> as well. <n>By</n> chance, <n>fifteen-year-old</n> <p>Garrod Ran</p> has discovered an old <n>Federation</n> mobile suit, the <n>Gundam X</n>, and now he uses it to help out the <n>Vulture</n> ship <n>Freeden</n> in its struggle to keep the powers that be from repeating the <n>mistakes</n> of the past.
