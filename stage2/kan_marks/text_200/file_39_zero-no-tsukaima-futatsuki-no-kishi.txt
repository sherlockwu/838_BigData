Revered as heroes for their role in defending <p>Tristain</p>, <p>Louise</p> and her familiar <p>Saito</p> face heavy pressure to continue protecting the <n>Kingdom</n>. With an uneasy peace now established within <n>Albion</n>, the newly crowned <p>Queen Henrietta</p> must deal with a political struggle brewing on the horizon. To make matters worse, a new villain has begun plotting in the shadows against the <p>Crown</p>.

With the continuing threats that face the <n>Kingdom</n>, <p>Louise</p> and <p>Saito</p> are compelled to work together once more. No longer "<p>Louise</p> the <p>Zero</p>," the young mage's newfound aptitude for Void magic gives her enough power to wipe out an entire village; however, wielding these abilities comes with its share of challenges. As more conflicts arise, the idea of placing honor above oneself is put into questionâ€”regardless of their answer, their only choice is to see it through until the end.
