Fear, survival, instinct. Thrown into a foreign land with nothing but hazy memories and the knowledge of their name, they can feel only these three emotions resonating deep within their souls. A group of strangers is given no other choice than to accept the only paying job in this game-like world—the role of a soldier in the <p>Reserve Army</p>—and eliminate anything that threatens the peace in their new world, <p>Grimgar</p>.

When all of the stronger candidates join together, those left behind must create a party together to survive: <p>Manato</p>, a charismatic leader and priest; <p>Haruhiro</p>, a nervous thief; <p>Yume</p>, a cheerful hunter; <p>Shihoru</p>, a shy mage; <p>Mogzo</p>, a kind warrior; and <p>Ranta</p>, a rowdy dark knight. Despite its resemblance to one, this is no game—there are no redos or respawns; it is kill or be killed. 

It is now up to this ragtag group of unlikely fighters to survive together in a world where life and death are separated only by a fine line.
