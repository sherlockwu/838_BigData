One day while riding the local train, <p>Shizuku</p> notices a strange cat sitting near her. Why would an ordinary cat ride a train? Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it can also seriously harm a young girl. <p>Shizuku</p> decides to follow the mysterious cat to see where it goes, and soon stumbles upon an antique shop run by a violin maker named <p>Nishi</p>, the grandfather of the mystery boy who shares her taste in literature. <p>Seiji</p> and <p>Shizuku</p> soon become friends and while <p>Seiji</p> is sure of his dreams and how to follow them, <p>Shizuku</p> is still unsure of her own talents. However, when she sees a strange cat statuette, “The <p>Baron</p>”, in the shop, it seems as if that statuette whispers something to her, tugging at her heart and giving her the inspiration she so desperately needed. One voice pushes <p>Shizuku</p> further than she could have ever imagined, changing her life forever.
