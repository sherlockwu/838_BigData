<p>Bakemono</p> no <p>Ko</p> is the tale of a boy and a beast: both lonely, both stubborn, and both strong. For nine-year-old <p>Ren</p>, things could hardly be worse. His mother has passed away in a traffic accident, his father is nowhere to be found, and his extended family is cold and distant. Desperate, <p>Ren</p> runs away to the mean streets of <p>Shibuya</p> to try and survive on his own.

In the beast realm of <p>Shibuten</p>, the fierce warrior <p>Kumatetsu</p> is certainly feared, but not especially liked or respected. When the <p>Lord</p> decides to retire and become a <p>God</p>, <p>Kumatetsu</p> would be a natural candidate to replace him; he and the noble <p>Lord</p> Iouzan are the two strongest in the land. But <p>Kumatetsu</p> is so anti-social he's never even managed to hold on to a disciple. And until he proves he can, he'll never be a serious contender.

When <p>Ren</p> gets lost in a maze of alleyways and finds himself in the strange land of <p>Shibuten</p>, fate brings these two stubborn and fierce-willed souls together, and <p>Kumatestu</p> re-names the boy "<p>Kyuuta</p>." Each of them has much they can teach the other, but where these two are concerned, nothing is going to be easy. As <p>Kyuuta</p> adjusts to his new home he finds himself torn between two worldsâ€”two worlds that are far less separate than either the Boy or the Beast realizes.
