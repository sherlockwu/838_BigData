<p><p>Ushio</p> Aotsuki</p> is a stubborn middle school student and son of an eccentric temple priest who goes about life without care for his father's claims regarding otherworldly monsters known as youkai. However, as he is tending to the temple while his father is away on work, his chores lead him to a shocking discovery: in the basement he finds a menacing youkai impaled by the fabled Beast Spear.

The beast in question is <p>Tora</p>, infamous for his destructive power, who tries to coerce <p>Ushio</p> into releasing him from his five hundred year seal. <p>Ushio</p> puts no trust in his words and refuses to set him free. But when a sudden youkai outbreak puts his friends and home in danger, he is left with no choice but to rely on <p>Tora</p>, his only insurance being the ancient spear if he gets out of hand.
