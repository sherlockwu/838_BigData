A group of ninja is planning to revive a powerful demon, and once its spirit is reunited with its body, the world will be destroyed. The only way to prevent this from happening is for <p>Shion</p>, a shrine maiden, to seal it away for good.

<p><p>Naruto</p> Uzumaki</p> is tasked to guard her, but one thing stops <p>Shion</p> from accepting his help: she also has the ability to predict death—and she has foreseen his demise approaching soon. In order to escape his fate, <p>Naruto</p> must stay away from <p>Shion</p>; however, undeterred, he chooses to challenge the prophecy in order to protect <p>Shion</p> and the world.
