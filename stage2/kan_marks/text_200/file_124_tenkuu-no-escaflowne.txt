<p><p>Hitomi</p> Kanzaki</p> is just an ordinary 15-year-old schoolgirl with an interest in tarot cards and fortune telling, but one night, a boy named <p><p>Van</p> Fanel</p> suddenly appears from the sky along with a vicious dragon. Thanks to a premonition from <p>Hitomi</p>, <p>Van</p> successfully kills the dragon, but a pillar of light appears and envelopes them both. As a result, <p>Hitomi</p> finds herself transported to the world of <p>Gaea</p>, a mysterious land where the <p>Earth</p> hangs in the sky.

In this new land, <p>Hitomi</p> soon discovers that <p>Van</p> is a prince of the <p>Kingdom</p> of <p>Fanelia</p>, which soon falls under attack by the evil empire of <p>Zaibach</p>. In an attempt to fight them off, <p>Van</p> boards his family's ancient guymelef Escaflowne—a mechanized battle suit—but fails to defeat them, and <p>Fanelia</p> ends up destroyed. Now on the run, <p>Hitomi</p> and <p>Van</p> encounter a handsome Asturian knight named <p>Allen Schezar</p>, whom <p>Hitomi</p> is shocked to find looks exactly like her crush from <p>Earth</p>. With some new allies on their side, <p>Van</p> and <p>Hitomi</p> fight back against the forces of <p>Zaibach</p> as the empire strives to revive an ancient power.
