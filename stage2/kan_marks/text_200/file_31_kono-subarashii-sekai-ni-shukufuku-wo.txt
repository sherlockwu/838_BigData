After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, high school student and recluse <p><p>Kazuma</p> Satou</p> finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named <p>Aqua</p>. She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream—a real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, <p>Kazuma</p> is quickly tasked with defeating a <p>Demon King</p> who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects <p>Aqua</p>. But <p>Kazuma</p> has made a grave mistake—<p>Aqua</p> is completely useless!

Unfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!
