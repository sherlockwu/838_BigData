Losing a loved one is so painful that one may sometimes wish to be able to resurrect them—a weakness that the enigmatic <p>Millennium Earl</p> exploits. To make his mechanical weapons known as "<n>Akuma</n>," he uses the souls of the dead that are called back. Once a soul is placed in an <n>Akuma</n>, it is trapped forever, and the only way to save them is to exorcise them from their vessel using the Anti-<n>Akuma</n> weapon, "<n>Innocence</n>."
 
After spending three years as the disciple of <n>General Cross</n>, <p>Allen Walker</p> is sent to the <n>Black Order</n>—an organization comprised of those willing to fight <n>Akuma</n> and the <p>Millennium Earl</p>—to become an official <p>Exorcist</p>. With an arm as his Innocence and a cursed eye that can see the suffering souls within an <n>Akuma</n>, it's up to <p>Allen</p> and his fellow <p>Exorcist</p>s to stop the <p>Millennium Earl</p>'s ultimate plot: one that can lead to the destruction of the world.
