Losing a loved one is so painful that one may sometimes wish to be able to resurrect them—a weakness that the enigmatic <p>Millennium Earl</p> exploits. To make his mechanical weapons known as "<p>Akuma</p>," he uses the souls of the dead that are called back. Once a soul is placed in an <p>Akuma</p>, it is trapped forever, and the only way to save them is to exorcise them from their vessel using the Anti-<p>Akuma</p> weapon, "Innocence."
 
After spending three years as the disciple of <p>General Cross</p>, <p><p>Allen</p> Walker</p> is sent to the <p>Black Order</p>—an organization comprised of those willing to fight <p>Akuma</p> and the <p>Millennium Earl</p>—to become an official <p>Exorcist</p>. With an arm as his Innocence and a cursed eye that can see the suffering souls within an <p>Akuma</p>, it's up to <p>Allen</p> and his fellow <p>Exorcist</p>s to stop the <p>Millennium Earl</p>'s ultimate plot: one that can lead to the destruction of the world.
