In ancient times, a group of young men devoted their lives to protecting <p>Athena</p>, the <n>Goddess</n> of <n>Wisdom</n> and <n>War</n>. These men were capable of fighting without weaponsâ€”a swing of their fist alone was powerful enough to rip the very sky apart and shatter the earth beneath them. These brave heroes became known as <p>Saints</p>, as they could summon up the power of the <n>Cosmos</n> from within themselves.

Now, in present day, a new generation of <n>Saints</n> is about to come forth. The young and spirited <p>Seiya</p> is fighting a tough battle for the Sacred Armor of <p>Pegasus</p>, and he isn't about to let anyone get in the way of him and his prize. Six years of hard work and training pay off with his victory and new title as one of <p>Athena</p>'s <n>Saints</n>.

But <p>Seiya</p>'s endeavor doesn't end there. In fact, plenty of perils and dangerous enemies face him and the rest of the <n>Saints</n> throughout the series. What new quests await the heroes of the epic Saint <p>Seiya</p> saga?
