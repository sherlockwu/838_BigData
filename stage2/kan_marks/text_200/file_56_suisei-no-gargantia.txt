In the distant future, a majority of humans have left the <n>Earth</n>, and the <p>Galactic Alliance</p> of <n>Humanity</n> is founded to guide exploration and ensure the prosperity of mankind. However, a significant threat arises in the form of strange creatures called <p>Hideauze</p>, resulting in an interstellar war to prevent humanity's extinction. Armed with <p>Chamber</p>, an autonomous robot, 16-year-old lieutenant <p>Ledo</p> of the <p>Galactic Alliance</p> joins the battle against the monsters. In an unfortunate turn of events, <p>Ledo</p> loses control during the battle and is cast out to the far reaches of space, crash-landing on a waterlogged <n>Earth</n>.

On the blue planet, <p>Gargantia</p>—a large fleet of scavenger ships—comes across <n>Chamber</n> and retrieves it from the ocean, thinking they have salvaged something of value. Mistaking their actions for hostility, <p>Ledo</p> sneaks aboard and takes a young messenger girl named <p>Amy</p> hostage, only to realize that the residents of <n>Gargantia</n> are not as dangerous as he had believed. Faced with uncertainty, and unable to communicate with his comrades in space, <p>Ledo</p> attempts to get his bearings and acclimate to a new lifestyle. But his peaceful days are about to be short-lived, as there is more to this ocean-covered planet than meets the eye.
