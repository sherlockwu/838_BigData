Based on a hit light novel series by <p>Keiichi Sigsawa</p>, the philosophical <p>Kino</p>'s Journey employs the time-honored motif of the road trip as a vehicle for self-discovery and universal truth. Deeply meditative and cooler than zero, the series follows the existential adventures of the apt marksman <p>Kino</p> along with talking motorcycle <n>Hermes</n> as they travel the world and learn much about themselves in the process. Imaginative, thought-provoking, and sometimes disturbing, <p>Kino</p>'s journey is documented in an episodic style with an emphasis on atmosphere rather than action or plot, though still prevalent.
