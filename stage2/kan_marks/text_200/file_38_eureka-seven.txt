In the backwater town of <p>Bellforest</p> lives a 14-year-old boy named <p><p>Renton</p> Thurston</p>. He desires to leave his home behind and join the mercenary group known as <p>Gekkostate</p>, hoping to find some adventure to brighten up his mundane life. However, stuck between his grandfather's insistence to become a mechanic like him and the pressure of his deceased father's legacy, the only excitement <p>Renton</p> finds is in his pastime of riding the <p>Trapar</p> wave particles that are dispersed throughout the air, an activity akin to surfing.

Everything changes when an unknown object crashes through <p>Renton</p>'s garage, discovered to be a Light <p>Finding Operation</p>—a robot capable of riding the <p>Trapar</p> waves—specifically known as the <p>Nirvash</p> typeZERO. Its pilot is a young girl named <p>Eureka</p>, a member of the <p>Gekkostate</p>, who requests a tune-up for the <p>Nirvash</p>. Their meeting sparks the beginning of <p>Renton</p>'s involvement with the <p>Gekkostate</p> as he takes off alongside <p>Eureka</p> as the co-pilot of the <p>Nirvash</p>.
