Ten years ago, a gigantic demon beast known as the <p>Nine-Tailed Demon Fox</p> was released from its jinchuuriki by an unknown shinobi wearing a mask. The village of <n>Konoha Gakure</n> was close to destruction by the attack of the Nine-Tails, but the village was saved by its leader. <p>Minato Namikaze</p> and his wife <p>Kushina Uzumaki</p>—who was the jinchuuriki at the time of the attack—sealed away the demon inside their new born son: <p><p>Naruto</p> Uzumaki</p>. However, this act of saving the village cost them their lives and they left the future of the ninja world to <p>Naruto</p>.

With the demon fox sealed away, things continued as normal. However, the peace of the village would not last long, for Pain, <p>Konan</p>, <p>Itachi Uchiha</p>, <p>Kisame Hoshigaki</p>, <p>Sasori</p>, <p>Deidara</p>, <p>Hidan</p> and <p>Kakuzu</p>—members of a dreaded shinobi group called the <p>Akatsuki</p>—attacked <p>Konoha</p>gakure</p>. <p>Naruto</p> narrowly manages to launch a counter-attack but why have these shinobi appeared when all of them were meant to have died? The mystery remains, but the shinobi are praised by heir families for completing such a dangerous mission. However, one of them who has never known the faces of his parents, <p>Naruto</p>, cannot help but feel lonely. At that exact time, suddenly, the masked man makes his appearance in <p>Konoha</p>. <p>Naruto</p> and his allies are both attacked by the man's mysterious new doujutsu.
