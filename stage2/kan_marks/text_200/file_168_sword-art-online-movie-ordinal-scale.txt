In 2022, the world of virtual reality was upended by the arrival of a new invention from a genius programmer, <p>Akihiko Kayaba</p>, called <p>NerveGear</p>. It was the first full-dive system, and with it, came endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.

In 2026, a new machine called the <p>Augma</p> is developed to compete against the <p>NerveGear</p> and its successor, the <p>Amusphere</p>. A next-gen wearable device, the <p>Augma</p> doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is "Ordinal <p>Scale</p>" (aka: <p>OS</p>), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the <p>Augma</p>.

<p>Asuna</p> and the gang have already been playing <p>OS</p> for a while, by the time <p>Kirito</p> decides to join them. They're about to find out that Ordinal <p>Scale</p> isn't all fun and games...
