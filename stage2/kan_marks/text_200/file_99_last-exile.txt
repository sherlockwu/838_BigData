In the world of <p>Prester</p>, flight is the dominant mode of transportation, made possible by <p>Claudia Fluid</p>: a liquidized form of the crystals that are produced on the planet. An organization known solely as "the <p>Guild</p>" has absolute authority over the skies, with a monopoly on the engines that make use of this fluid. Moreover, as ecological disasters destabilize the warring countries of <p>Anatoray</p> and <p>Disith</p>, the <p>Guild</p> also arbitrates in the disputes between the two. <p>Caught</p> in the middle of the conflict are <p>Sky Couriers</p>, piloting small, two-person vanships that fly freely through the sky.

Last Exile follows the adventures of two teenagers who dream of surpassing their parents: <p><p>Claus</p> Valca</p>, son of a famous vanship pilot, and <p>Lavie Head</p>, <p>Claus</p>' best friend and navigator. Their job as couriers entails passing through an air current called the <p>Grand Stream</p> that separates the hostile nations, which even standard airships struggle to survive. However, when they take on a high-rated delivery to bring an orphan girl named <p>Alvis Hamilton</p> to the battleship <p>Silvana</p>, they get dragged into a much greater conflict that pits them against the might of the <p>Guild</p>.
