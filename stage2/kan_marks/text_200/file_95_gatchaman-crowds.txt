<p><p>Hajime</p> Ichinose</p>'s ordinary life is in for a change when a transcendent being named <p>J.J Robinson</p> hands her a small book called NOTE—a device which transforms her into one of the <p>Gatchaman</p>, the legendary protectors of <p>Tachikawa City</p>. Stressing that the existence of their group must remain a secret, fellow <p>Gatchaman</p> Sugane Tachibana takes <p>Hajime</p> to their base of operations, where <p>Paiman</p>, the panda-like alien leader of the <p>Gatchaman</p>, reveals their purpose: to eliminate aliens that pose a danger to humanity. These existential threats, called MESS, are becoming increasingly dangerous, destroying everything they touch. Now it's up to the <p>Gatchaman</p> and their new recruit to stop them before the world is engulfed in chaos.
