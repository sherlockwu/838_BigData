<p>Dragon Ball</p> GT takes place five years after <p>Gokuu</p> left to train his apprentice <p>Uub</p>, whose training is now complete. During the final stages of <p>Uub</p>'s training, <p>Gokuu</p>'s old foe <p>Emperor Pilaf</p> infiltrates the Lookout to make a wish on the Black Star <p>Dragon Ball</p>s. Due to a slip of the tongue, Pilaf is once again denied world domination and <p>Gokuu</p> is instead turned back into a child. Who could have imagined the dangers that would soon follow this lighthearted event?

Making a wish on the Black Star <p>Dragon Ball</p>s causes the planet they are used on to explode exactly one year after the wish has been granted. And the Black Star <p>Dragon Ball</p>s do not simply scatter across the <p>Earth</p>, they scatter across the entire galaxy. It is up to <p>Gokuu</p>, <p>Trunks</p>, and Pan to retrieve the Balls and save the <p>Earth</p>, but they will find many enemies who are a far greater threat than <p>Emperor Pilaf</p> on their journey throughout the galaxy.
