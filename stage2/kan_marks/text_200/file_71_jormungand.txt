<p>Jormungand</p> follows <p>Koko</p>, <p>Jonah</p>, and the rest of crew as they travel the world selling weapons under the international shipping company HCLI.

With the <p>CIA</p> always hot on her trail, and assassins around every corner, <p>Jonah</p> and the crew must guard <p>Koko</p> and her dream of world peace with their lives or die trying.
