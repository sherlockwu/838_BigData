Thousands of years ago, the ancient dragon <p>Bahamut</p> wrought havoc upon the land of <p>Mistarcia</p>, a world where both gods and demons live amongst mankind. Working together to prevent the world's destruction, the rival deities barely managed to seal <p>Bahamut</p>, agreeing to split the key between them so that the dragon would remain eternally imprisoned.

Living a laid-back, self-serving lifestyle, the amoral <p>Favaro</p> goes about his work while on the run from fellow bounty hunter <p>Kaisar Lidfard</p>, a righteous man who swears vengeance upon <p>Favaro</p>. However, <p>Favaro</p>'s carefree life is thrown into chaos when he meets <p>Amira</p>, a mysterious woman who holds half of the key to the world's fragile peace.
