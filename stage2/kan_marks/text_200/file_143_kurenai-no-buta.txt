<p><p>Porco</p> Rosso</p> is a veteran <p>WWI</p> fighter pilot turned bounty hunter, who has been transformed into an anthropomorphic pig through a rare curse. He was once known as <p>Marco Pagot</p> while still in his human form, but took up a new alias which suits his current image better, "<p>Red Pig</p>."

At the beginning of <p>Kurenai</p> no <p>Buta</p>, <p>Porco</p> is reunited with his long-time friend <p>Gina</p> at a hotel, and unexpectedly falls in love with her. Despite his strange form, <p>Gina</p> shows him all the affection that she can muster. But <p>Porco</p> has a love rival to deal with. An American ace fighter named <p>Curtis</p> is also after <p>Gina</p>'s heart, and although she rejects his proposals, he is not about to let her go so easily. During his return flight to <p>Milan</p>, <p>Curtis</p> sneaks up behind <p>Porco</p>'s plane and shoots him down. The plane is completely destroyed and <p>Porco</p> is proclaimed dead, but due to a stroke of luck, he barely managed to survive the crash, unbeknownst to others.

<p>Porco</p> must now continue his journey back by train, and suddenly discovers that there has been a warrant issued for his arrest in <p>Italy</p>. Not only does he need to find <p>Gina</p>, but he must also get his revenge and also deal with the oncoming war that threatens the whole of <p>Europe</p>.
