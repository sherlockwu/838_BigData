A young wavemaster, only known by the alias of <p>Tsukasa</p>, wakes up in an MMORPG called The <p>World</p>, with slight amnesia. He does not know what he has previously done before he woke up. In The <p>World</p>, he is suspected to be a hacker of the <p>Crimson Knights</p>, as he was seen accompanying a tweaked character in the form of a cat. Unable to log out from the game, he wanders around looking for answers, avoiding the knights and other players he meets along the way.

As <p>Tsukasa</p> explores The <p>World</p>, he stumbles upon a magical item that takes the form of a "guardian," which promises him protection from all harm. <p>Subaru</p>, the leader of the <p>Crimson Knights</p>, along with several other players who became acquainted with <p>Tsukasa</p>, set out to investigate why <p>Tsukasa</p> is unable to log out, and attempt to get to the bottom of the problem before it gets out of hand.
