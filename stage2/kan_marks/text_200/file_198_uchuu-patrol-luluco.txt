Living an abnormal existence in <p>Ogikubo</p>, an intergalactic melting pot of humans and aliens as well as the only Space <p>Immigration Zone</p> on <p>Earth</p>, <p>Luluco</p> is a bubbly middle school girl who just wants to be normal. One morning, however, her father, who works at the Space <p>Patrol</p>, eats a volatile sleep capsule by mistake and is frozen solid! To make matters worse, <p>Luluco</p> accidentally breaks him, so she hurries off to his office for help. There, the chief of the Space <p>Patrol</p>, <p>Over Justice</p>, hires <p>Luluco</p> as a space temp worker for undercover investigations, so that the institution may crack down on crime within her school.

Made to don the Space <p>Patrol</p> suit and sent on her way to mete out justice, <p>Luluco</p> attempts to maintain the image of a normal girl who does not stand out in any way. But she soon discovers that with the automatic systems and inherently zealous judiciousness of the Space <p>Patrol</p> suit, continuing to be normal will be more difficult than she thought.
