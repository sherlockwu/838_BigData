<p><p>Sakura</p> Kinomoto</p> is your garden-variety ten-year-old fourth grader, until one day, she stumbles upon a mysterious book containing a set of cards. Unfortunately, she has little time to divine what the cards mean because she accidentally stirs up a magical gust of wind and unintentionally scatters the cards all over the world. Suddenly awakened from the book, the Beast of the <p>Seal</p>, <p>Keroberos</p> (nicknamed Kero-chan), tells <p>Sakura</p> that she has released the mystical <p><p>Clow</p> <p>Cards</p></p> created by the sorcerer <p><p>Clow</p> Reed</p>. The <p>Cards</p> are no ordinary playthings. Each of them possesses incredible powers, and because they like acting independently, <p>Clow</p> sealed all the <p>Cards</p> within a book. Now that the <p>Cards</p> are set free, they pose a grave danger upon the world, and it is up to <p>Sakura</p> to prevent the <p>Cards</p> from causing a catastrophe!

Appointing <p>Sakura</p> the title of "the <p>Cardcaptor</p>" and granting her the <p>Seal</p>ed Key, <p>Keroberos</p> tasks her with finding and recapturing all the <p>Cards</p>. Alongside her best friend <p>Tomoyo Daidouji</p>, and with Kero-chan's guidance, <p>Sakura</p> must learn to balance her new secret duty with the everyday troubles of a young girl involving love, family, and school, all while she takes flight on her magical adventures as <p>Sakura</p> the <p>Cardcaptor</p>.
