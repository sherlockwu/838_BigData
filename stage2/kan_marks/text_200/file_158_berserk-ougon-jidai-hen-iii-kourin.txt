One year has passed since <p>Guts</p> left the Band of the Hawk and <p>Griffith</p> was imprisoned by the <n>Kingdom</n> of <n>Midland</n> for treason.

In the dead of night, at a camping site where they hide, the Band of the Hawk is attacked by <p>Bakiraka</p> assassins led by <p>Silat</p>. When all seems lost, <p>Guts</p> returns from his journey. "You destroyed everything." Crying that <p>Griffith</p> is nothing without <p>Guts</p>, <p>Casca</p> and <p>Guts</p> are joined together body and soul. <p>Griffith</p> is imprisoned in the oldest building in <n>Wyndham Catle</n>, the <n>Tower</n> of <p>Rebirth</p>. They discover that <p>Griffith</p> has been tortured, with the tendons of his legs and arms severed and his tongue removed. Seeing <p>Guts</p> and <p>Casca</p> pitying him, <p>Griffith</p> drags his body along the ground. At that moment, the Egg of the <n>King <n>Behelit</p></p> that he had thought lost returns to his hand. The <p>Behelit</p> resonated with <p>Griffith</p>'s despair and screams, causing a shockwave that creates a twisted dimension. The <n>God</n> Hand descends. A nightmare of magnificent violence erupts as a horde of apostles devour the Band of the Hawk. This is the birth of the fifth guardian and the beginning of an age where darkness overcomes all light.
