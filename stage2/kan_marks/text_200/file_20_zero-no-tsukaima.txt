<p>Louise</p> Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is a self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at <p>Tristain Academy</p>, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: <p>Louise</p> is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of "<p>Louise</p> the <p>Zero</p>" from her classmates.

When the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, <p>Louise</p>'s summoning results in a catastrophic explosion! Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named <p><p>Saito</p> Hiraga</p> appears. Now <p>Louise</p>'s familiar, <p>Saito</p> is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on <p>Saito</p>'s hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named <p>Gandalfr</p>.

<p>Wild</p>, adventurous, and explosive, <p>Zero</p> no Tsukaima follows <p>Saito</p> as he comes to terms with his new life and as <p>Louise</p> proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.
