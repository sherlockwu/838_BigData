It's been six years since that summer adventure when <p><p>Taichi</p> Yagami</p> and the rest of the <p>DigiDestined</p> crossed over to the <p>Digital World</p>. And nearly three years have passed since the final battle between <p>Hikari Yagami</p>'s group and <p>BelialVamdemon</p>. As the peaceful days passed by, at some point the gate to the <p>Digital World</p> closed. Not even the <p>DigiDestined</p> know what caused this, and time alone continues to pass.

On one such day, a <p>Kuwagamon</p> suddenly appears in <p>Odaiba</p>. Its rampage leaves the town in ruins, and the people there in turmoil. <p>Taichi</p> happens to catch sight of the <p>Kuwagamon</p>, and he chases after it all by himself in an effort to halt its rampage. But there's nothing he can do against a <p>Kuwagamon</p>.

"It's no use... I can't do anything about this alone..."
Just as the <p>Kuwagamon</p> roars and attacks <p>Taichi</p>, his Digivice begins to emit a bright light...

"<p>Taichi</p>, look how big you've grown!"
With the sound of that nostalgic voice, the story once again begins to move in a big way.

<p><p>Taichi</p> Yagami</p>, age 17; high school student.
The adventure now evolves once again.
