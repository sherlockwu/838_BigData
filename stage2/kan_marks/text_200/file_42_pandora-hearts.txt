To young <p><p>Oz</p> <p>Vessalius</p></p>, heir to the <p><p>Vessalius</p> Duke House</p>, the perilous world called the <p>Abyss</p> is nothing more than a folktale used to scare misbehaving children. However, when <p>Oz</p>'s coming-of-age ceremony is interrupted by the malicious <p>Baskerville Clan</p> intent on banishing him into the depths of the <p>Abyss</p>, the <p>Vessalius</p> heir realizes that his peaceful life of luxury is at its end. Now, he must confront the world of the <p>Abyss</p> and its dwellers, the monstrous "<p>Chain</p>s," which are both not quite as fake as he once believed.
