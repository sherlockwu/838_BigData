<p>Death City</p> is home to the famous <p>Shibusen</p>, a technical academy headed by the <p>Shinigami</p>–<p>Lord Death</p> himself. Its mission: to raise "<p><p>Death Scythe</p>s</p>" for the <p>Shinigami</p> to wield against the many evils of their fantastical world. These <p><p>Death Scythe</p>s</p>, however, are not made from physical weapons; rather, they are born from human hybrids who have the ability to transform their bodies into <p>Demon Weapons</p>, and only after they have consumed the souls of 99 evil beings and one witch's soul.
 
Soul <p>Eater Evans</p>, a <p>Demon Scythe</p> who only seems to care about what's cool, aims to become a <p>Death Scythe</p> with the help of his straight-laced wielder, or meister, <p>Maka Albarn</p>. The contrasting duo work and study alongside the hot headed Black☆Star and his caring weapon <p>Tsubaki</p>, as well as the <p>Shinigami</p>'s own son, Death the Kid, an obsessive-compulsive dual wielder of twin pistols <p>Patty</p> and <p>Liz</p>.
 
Soul Eater follows these students of <p>Shibusen</p> as they take on missions to collect souls and protect the city from the world's threats while working together under the snickering sun to become sounder in mind, body, and soul.
