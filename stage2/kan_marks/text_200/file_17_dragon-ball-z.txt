Five years after winning the <p>World Martial Arts</p> tournament, <p>Gokuu</p> is now living a peaceful life with his wife and son. This changes, however, with the arrival of a mysterious enemy named <p>Raditz</p> who presents himself as <p>Gokuu</p>'s long-lost brother. He reveals that <p>Gokuu</p> is a warrior from the once powerful but now virtually extinct <p>Saiyan</p> race, whose homeworld was completely annihilated. When he was sent to <p>Earth</p> as a baby, <p>Gokuu</p>'s sole purpose was to conquer and destroy the planet; but after suffering amnesia from a head injury, his violent and savage nature changed, and instead was raised as a kind and well-mannered boy, now fighting to protect others.

With his failed attempt at forcibly recruiting <p>Gokuu</p> as an ally, <p>Raditz</p> warns <p>Gokuu</p>'s friends of a new threat that's rapidly approaching <p>Earth</p>â€”one that could plunge <p>Earth</p> into an intergalactic conflict and cause the heavens themselves to shake. A war will be fought over the seven mystical dragon balls, and only the strongest will survive in <p>Dragon Ball Z.</p>
