In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called <p>Sword Art Online</p> (<p>SAO</p>) is launched. With the aid of "<p>NerveGear</p>" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.

<p>Kazuto Kirigaya</p>, nicknamed "<p>Kirito</p>," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of <p>Aincrad</p>, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.

In order to escape <p>Aincrad</p>, <p>Kirito</p> will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like <p>Asuna Yuuki</p>, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, <p>Sword Art Online</p> is not all fun and games: if they die in <p>Aincrad</p>, they die in real life. <p>Kirito</p> must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.
