Approached by officials to assist in investigating the murders, <p>Kazuto</p> assumes his persona of <p>Kirito</p> once again and logs into <p>Gun Gale Online</p>, intent on stopping the killer.

Once inside, <p>Kirito</p> meets <p>Sinon</p>, a highly skilled sniper afflicted by a traumatic past. She is soon dragged in his chase after <p>Death</p> Gun, and together they enter the <p>Bullet</p> of <p>Bullet</p>s, a tournament where their target is sure to appear. <p>Uncertain</p> of <p>Death</p> Gun's real powers, <p>Kirito</p> and <p>Sinon</p> race to stop him before he has the chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, <p>Kirito</p> puts his life on the line in the virtual world once more.
