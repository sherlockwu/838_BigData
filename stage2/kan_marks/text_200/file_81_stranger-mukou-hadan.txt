In the Sengoku period of <n>Japan</n>, a young orphan named <p>Kotarou</p> and his dog <p>Tobimaru</p> steal from unsuspecting villagers in order to make ends meet. However, <p>Kotarou</p> is forced to remain on the run when he finds himself being hunted down by assassins sent by <n>China</n>'s <n>Ming Dynasty</n> for mysterious reasons not involving his petty crimes. 

Fortunately, the duo run into <p>Nanashi</p>, a ronin who has taken refuge in a small temple, when <p>Kotarou</p> is attacked and <p>Tobimaru</p> poisoned. Although the samurai  saves the helpless pair from their pursuers, he feels that there is no need to help them further; but when offered a gem in exchange for his services as a bodyguard, he reluctantly accepts <p>Kotarou</p>'s offer of employmentâ€”just until <p>Tobimaru</p> is healed and the two reach their destination. As the three set out on a perilous journey, it soon becomes evident that their path is riddled with danger, as the <n>Ming Dynasty</n> has now sent a terrifying swordsman after them to capture <p>Kotarou</p> and fulfill a certain prophecy.
