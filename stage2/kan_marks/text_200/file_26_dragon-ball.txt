<p><p>Gokuu</p> Son</p> is a young boy who lives in the woods all aloneâ€”that is, until a girl named <p>Bulma</p> runs into him in her search for a set of magical objects called the "<p>Dragon Balls</p>." Since the artifacts are said to grant one wish to whoever collects all seven, <p>Bulma</p> hopes to gather them and wish for a perfect boyfriend. <p>Gokuu</p> happens to be in possession of a <p>dragon</p> ball, but unfortunately for <p>Bulma</p>, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the <p>dragon</p> ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.

They don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old <p>Muten-Roshi</p> and wannabe disciple <p>Kuririn</p>, with whom <p>Gokuu</p> trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World <p>Martial Arts Tournament</p>. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.
