Upon their arrival, the group gains a new comrade: <p>Iggy</p>, a mutt who wields the Stand "The Fool." It's not all good news however, as standing in their path is a new group of Stand users who serve <p>Dio</p>, each with a Stand representative of an ancient <p>Egypt</p>ian god. As their final battle approaches, it is a race against time to break <p>Joutarou</p>'s mother free from her curse and end <p>Dio</p>'s reign of terror over the <p>Joestar</p> family once and for all.
