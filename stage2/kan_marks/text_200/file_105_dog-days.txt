Dog Days takes place in the world of <p>Flonyard</p>, an alternate <p>Earth</p> inhabited by beings who resemble humans, but also have the ears and tails of specific animals. The <p>Republic</p> of <p>Biscotti</p>, a union of dog-like citizens, has come under attack by the feline forces of the <p>Galette Leo Knights</p>. In an effort to save <p>Biscotti</p>, <p>Princess Millhiore</p> summons a champion from another world in order to defend her people. That champion is <p><p>Cinque</p> Izumi</p>, a normal junior high student from <p>Earth</p>.

Agreeing to assist <p>Biscotti</p>, <p>Cinque</p> retrieves a sacred weapon called the Palladion and prepares for war. In <p>Flonyard</p>, wars are fought with no casualties and are more akin to sports competitions with the goal of raising money for the participating kingdoms. <p>Cinque</p> is successful in his role as <p>Biscotti</p>’s champion, but learns that a summoned champion cannot be returned to their home world. The scientists of <p>Biscotti</p> will endeavor to find a way for <p>Cinque</p> to return home, but until they figure something out, he must serve <p>Princess Millhiore</p> by continuing to fight as <p>Biscotti</p>’s hero.
