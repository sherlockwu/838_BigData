<p>Jubei Kibagami</p> wanders feudal <n>Japan</n> as an itinerant swordsman-for-hire. After a past betrayal left him masterless, he has no more patience for warring political factions and their schemes. Unfortunately, both past and political intrigue collide when he meets and saves a female ninja named <p>Kagero</p> from a man with the ability to make his body as hard as stone.

The sole survivor of a ninja clan, <n>Kagero</n> continues her team's last mission: investigate a mysterious plague that wiped out an entire village. <p>Jubei</p> wants nothing to do with this, but the stone-like man's allies, a group of ninja with supernatural powers known as the Devils of <p>Kimon</p>, make that option difficult. To make matters worse, a government spy poisons <p>Jubei</p>, promising him an antidote if he can unravel the true intentions of the Devils of <p>Kimon</p> and their connection to the plague. The trail leads to shadow leaders, a plot to overthrow the government, and a man that <p>Jubei</p> thought he would never see again.
