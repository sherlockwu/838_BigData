The world of <n>Auldrant</n> is bound by the Score, a series of prophecies from centuries past that dictate the world's future. It is considered an absolute fate that everyone lives by—even people whose actions lead to bloodshed and tears. Using magical abilities known as the <n>Fonic</n> Arts, a war between the nation of <n>Kimlasca-Lanvaldear</n> and the <n>Malkuth Empire</n> is waged in hopes of bringing the Score's foreseen utopia to life.

Tales of the <n>Abyss</n> follows <p>Luke von Fabre</p>, who spends his days locked away in his manor after being kidnapped and losing memories as a child. One day, while honing his swordsmanship, a woman named <p>Tear</p> attempts to assassinate his master. <p>Luke</p> defends him, but the clash results in the two being teleported to a distant land. <p>Luke</p> and <p>Tear</p>’s journey back quickly escalates into a quest that will either free the world from the Score's chains or destroy it completely.
