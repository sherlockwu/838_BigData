<p>Haru Yoshioka</p> is your ordinary high school girl who has trouble making decisions for herself. One day, she spots a strange cat crossing the road with a small present... and a truck headed straight for it! <p>Haru</p> doesnâ€™t even stop to think before jumping in front of the truck and getting them both to safety.

This one selfless act initiates a chain of events that sends <p>Haru</p> on an epic adventure. The cat she saved turns out to be no ordinary feline, but <p>Lune</p>, <n>Prince</n> of the Cats. In honour of her bravery and for saving his life, he offers to marry her. <p>Haru</p> mutters a reply which is taken to be a "yes", and for better or for worse, her fate is sealed. 

Alongside her cat companions <p>Muta</p> and the <p>Baron</p>, she's aided from above by a raven named <p>Toto</p>, and must travel to the cat world in order to rectify this misunderstanding. Her journey is tougher than it seems: If she cannot escape from the claws of the <n>King</n> of the Cats and find her true self, she will be turned into a cat forever.

<p>Haru</p> may start off as an everyday girl, but after her descent into the world of cats, she returns a different beast entirely.
