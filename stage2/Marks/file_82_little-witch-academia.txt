For young witches everywhere, the world-renowned witch <p>Shiny Chariot</p> reigns as the most revered and celebrated role model. But as the girls age, so do their opinions of her—now just the mention of <p>Chariot</p> would get a witch labeled a child. However, undeterred in her blind admiration for <p>Chariot</p>, ordinary girl <p><p>Atsuko Kagari</p> enrolls into <n>Luna Nova Magical Academy</n>, hoping to someday become just as mesmerizing as her idol.

However, the witch academy isn't all the fun and games <p>Atsuko</p> thought it would be: boring lectures, strict teachers, and students who mock <p>Chariot</p> plague the campus. Coupled with her own ineptness in magic, she's seen as little more than a rebel student. But when a chance finally presents itself to prove herself to her peers and teachers, she takes it, and now it's up to her to stop a rampaging dragon before it flattens the entire academy.
