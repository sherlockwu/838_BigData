You can tell witch training is not going swimmingly for the young sorceresses <p>Akko</p>, <p>Lotte</p>, and <p>Sucy</p>â€”they face expulsion for screwing up one class too many, and their only way out is if they successfully organize their academy's annual parade through a nearby town. But when they stumble upon the momentous discovery that the objective of the parade is to humiliate witches and commemorate their past subjugation, <p>Akko</p> decides it is time for a change: It is time to show the world how fantastic modern witches truly are! However, with the other girls struggling to keep up with <p>Akko</p>'s grandiose ambitions, and everything from mischievous boys to slumbering giants getting in their way, maybe pulling it off will require not only all the magical prowess the pupils of <n>Luna Nova</n> Magical Academy can muster, but also a miracle.
