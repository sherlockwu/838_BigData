40 years ago, a <p>Celebi</p> was being attacked by a Pokemon <p>Hunter</p>. Luckily, a young boy named <p>Sammy</p> saved <p>Celebi</p>. Using its <n>Time</n> Traveling power, <p>Celebi</p> transported himself and <p>Sammy</p> 40 years into the future. There, <p>Ash</p>, <p>Misty</p>, and <p>Brock</p> assist <p>Sammy</p> to the healing lake in the forest so they can heal the wounded <p>Celebi</p>. Unfortunately an evil <p>Team Rocket</p> member, Viscious a.k.a. "The <p>Iron Masked Marauder</p>", tries to capture <p>Celebi</p> using his technology. As <p>Ash</p> and <p>Co.</p> try to get away from Viscious, they also run into <p>Jessie</p>, <p>James</p>, and <p>Meowth</p>, who also want to capture <p>Celebi</p>. Soon it becomes a race against time to get <p>Celebi</p> and <p>Sammy</p> back to the forest before <p>Celebi</p> is caught and is used to destroy the forest and themselves.
