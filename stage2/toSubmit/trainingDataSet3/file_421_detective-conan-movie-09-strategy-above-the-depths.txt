<n>Six</n> <n>months</n> have passed since then. <p>Conan</p>, <p>Ran</p>, and <p>Kogoro</p> are enjoying their <p>trip</p> in the <p>Aphrodite</p>. <p>The Aphrodite</p> is a luxury <n>liner</n>, which is sailing for the <n>Pacific Ocean</n> as its maiden <n>voyage</n>. <n>However</n>, there is a suspicious <n>person</n>, and finally a <n>murder</n> occurs.
