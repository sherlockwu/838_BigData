A battle is about to begin in <n>Tokyo</n>: the <n>Shaman</n> Fight, a tournament held every five hundred years where shaman—those who can command spirits—confront each other in combat. The victor of this contest becomes the <n>Shaman</n> King and the only one who is able to contact and control the Great Spirit, allowing them to reshape the world as they please through its immense power.

During a late night walk, <p>Manta Oyamada</p> runs into his classmate, the carefree You <p>Asakura</p>, who invites him to come stargazing with some friends, who, to <p>Manta</p>'s horror, turn out to be ghosts from a local cemetery! However, the knowledge that <p>Manta</p> possesses—a rare sixth sense that allows <p>Manta</p> to see these spirits—endears the boy to You. So when You finds out that his new comrade has been beaten up by a local gang, he decides to avenge him with the help of <p>Amidamaru</p>, a samurai ghost whose tomb was broken by the gang leader. 

Soon <p>Manta</p> uncovers more about the world of spirits, including the <n>Shaman</n> Fight, in which his new friend You aims to claim victory.
