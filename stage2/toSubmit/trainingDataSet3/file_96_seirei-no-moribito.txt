On the precipice of a cataclysmic drought, the <n>Star</n> Readers of the <n>Shin Yogo Empire</n> must devise a plan to avoid widespread famine. It is written in ancient myths that the first emperor, along with eight warriors, slew a water demon to avoid a great drought and save the land that was to become <n>Shin Yogo</n>. If a water demon was to appear once more, its death could bring salvation. However, the water demon manifests itself within the body of the emperor's son, <p>Prince Chagum</p>â€”by the emperor's order, <p>Chagum</p> is to be sacrificed to save the empire.

Meanwhile, a mysterious spear-wielding mercenary named <p>Balsa</p> arrives in <n>Shin Yogo</n> on business. After saving <p>Chagum</p> from a thinly veiled assassination attempt, she is tasked by <p>Chagum</p>'s mother to protect him from the emperor and his hunters. Bound by a sacred vow she once made, <p>Balsa</p> accepts.

<p>Seirei</p> no <p>Moribito</p> follows <p>Balsa</p> as she embarks on her journey to protect <p>Chagum</p>, exploring the beauty of life, nature, family, and the bonds that form between strangers.
