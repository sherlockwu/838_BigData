<n>While</n> riding with <p>Jack Atlas</p> and <p>Crow Hogan</p>, <p>Yuusei Fudou</p>'s <n>Stardust Dragon</n> is captured by <p>Paradox</p>, a mysterious <n>Turbo Duelist</n> from the future, during a <n>Turbo Duel</n> and turned into a <n>Sin Monster</n>. <n>With</n> the help of the <n>Crimson Dragon</n>, <p>Yuusei</p> chases after <p>Paradox</p> as he enters a time slip, ending up in the past. <n>During</n> this time, <p>Paradox</p> duels against <p>Jaden Yuki</p>, who is still able to use the powers of <p>Yubel</p> and <n>The Supreme King</n>. <n>However</n>, by this time <n>Paradox</n> had also captured <n>Cyber End Dragon</n> and <n>Rainbow Dragon</n> and overwhelms <p>Jaden</p>. He is saved thanks to <p>Yuusei</p> and the <p>Crimson Dragon</p>. <p>Jaden</p> informs <p>Yuusei</p> of <p>Paradox</p>'s true intentions. <n>By</n> stealing various monsters from across time and turning them dark, he plans to kill <p>Maximillion Pegasus</p>, the creator of <n>Duel Monsters</n>, preventing the game from being created and causing the events of all three series to never happen.

<p>Yuusei</p> and <p>Jaden</p> agree to pursue <p>Paradox</p>, which leads them to the past and causes a meeting with the <n>King of Games</n>, <p>Yuugi Mutou</p>. <n>However</n>, by the time <p>Yuusei</p> and <p>Jaden</p> arrive, <p>Paradox</p> had already attacked his time, supposedly killing both <p>Pegasus</p> and <p>Yuugi</p>'s grandpa, and had also managed to steal <n>Blue-Eyes</n> <n>White Dragon</n> and <n>Red-Eyes</n> <n>Black Dragon</n>. <n>After</n> explaining everything to <p>Yuugi</p>, he agrees to fight with <p>Yuusei</p> and <p>Jaden</p> against <p>Paradox</p> in the ultimate three-on-one duel to free the trapped monsters and save both the world and time itself before it's too late.
