<n>It</n> is the <n>Correct Century</n>, two millenniums after a devastating <n>conflict</n> which left the world broken. <n>Earth</n> is now mostly uninhabitable, and thus a <n>remnant</n> of <n>humanity</n> has resided on the <n>Moon</n> while the <n>Earth</n> and its few <n>survivors</n> recover. <n>For</n> years, the "<n>Moonrace</n>," people of the <n>Moon</n>, have continued to check if <n>Earth</n> is fit for <n>resettlement</n>.

<n>A</n> boy named <p>Rolan Cehack</p> and two others are sent down to <n>Earth</n> for a <n>reconnaissance mission</n>. <p>Rolan</p> ends up spending a year on the planet working for the <n>Heim Family</n>, <n>aristocrats</n> living in a <n>Victorian-like</n> society. <n>This</n> family, like others of similar wealthy status, celebrates one's coming of age with a <n>ceremony</n> involving a giant stone statue known as the "<n>White Doll</n>

<n>To</n> <p>Rolan's</p> surprise, the <n>Moonrace</n> suddenly touches down on <n>Earth</n> with the <n>intent</n> of taking it by <n>force</n>. <n>During</n> the <n>attack</n>, the <n>White Doll</n> is broken apart, revealing a <n>mobile suit</n> called the "<n>Turn A Gundam</n>" inside. <n>With Rolan</n> in its <n>cockpit<n>, the <n>Turn A</n> causes a <n>standoff</n> between the forces of <n>Earth and Moon</n>. <n>The</n> young pilot, along with the people of both sides, must keep the peace and avoid another <n>all-out</n>, <n>catastrophic war</n>.
