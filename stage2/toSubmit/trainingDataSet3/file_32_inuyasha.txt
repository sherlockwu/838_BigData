Based on the <p>Shogakukan</p> award-winning manga of the same name, <p>InuYasha</p> follows <p>Kagome Higurashi</p>, a fifteen-year-old girl whose normal life ends when a demon drags her into a cursed well on the grounds of her family's Shinto shrine. Instead of hitting the bottom of the well, <p>Kagome</p> ends up 500 years in the past during <n>Japan</n>'s violent Sengoku period with the demon's true target, a wish-granting jewel called the <n>Shikon Jewel</n>, reborn inside of her.

After a battle with a revived demon accidentally causes the sacred jewel to shatter, <p>Kagome</p> enlists the help of a young hybrid dog-demon/human named <p>Inuyasha</p> to help her collect the shards and prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Joining <p>Kagome</p> and <p>Inuyasha</p> on their quest are the orphan fox-demon <p>Shippo</p>, the intelligent monk <p>Miroku</p>, and the lethal demon slayer <p>Sango</p>. Together, they must set aside their differences and work together to find the power granting shards spread across feudal <n>Japan</n> and deal with the threats that arise.
