Thousands of years ago, the ancient dragon <p>Bahamut</p> wrought havoc upon the land of <n>Mistarcia</n>, a world where both gods and demons live amongst mankind. Working together to prevent the world's destruction, the rival deities barely managed to seal <p>Bahamut</p>, agreeing to split the key between them so that the dragon would remain eternally imprisoned.

Living a laid-back, self-serving lifestyle, the amoral <p>Favaro</p> goes about his work while on the run from fellow bounty hunter <p>Kaisar Lidfard</p>, a righteous man who swears vengeance upon <p>Favaro</p>. However, <p>Favaro</p>'s carefree life is thrown into chaos when he meets <p>Amira</p>, a mysterious woman who holds half of the key to the world's fragile peace.

<p>Shingeki</p> no <p>Bahamut</p>: <p>Genesis</p> tells the story of a group of unlikely heroes who find themselves caught in the middle of an epic clash between gods and demons, forced to carve their own path in the face of the imminent storm.
