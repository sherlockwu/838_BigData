<n>In</n> the year <n>2010 AD</n>, <p>Hyper Hurricanes</p> born concurrently all over the world caused severe <n>damage</n>. <n>Five</n> billion people lost their lives, decreasing the world's population to 3 billion. <n>Existing</n> economies and military were wiped out. <n>Countries</n> were frozen under solid ice, plains sank beneath <n>seas</n>, <n>the world</n> was changed dramatically.

<n>Human</n> civilization enters a chaotic era. <n>Poverty</n> flourished outside of these economic <n>zones</n> and slums were widespread. <n>The</n> ruling class called themselves <n>Logos</n> and maintained their position by force of arms. <n>They</n> call the poor <n>Revenus</n>, who are exiled to live outside the special economic <n>areas</n>.

<n>Time</n> has passed since then. <p>Katsuragi Jo</p> and <p>Tsurasawa Jin</p>, escape from <n>Phantom</n>, a force organized to watch <n>Revenus</n> and to suppress renegade <n>elements</n> of the <n>Logos</n>, taking with them a <n>mysterious girl</n>, <p>Nobuto Sana</p>. <n>There</n> are many who are interested in her, all with their own reasons.
