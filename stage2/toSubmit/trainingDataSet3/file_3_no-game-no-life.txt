No Game <n>No Life</n> is a surreal comedy that follows <p>Sora</p> and <p>Shiro</p>, shut-in NEET siblings and the online gamer duo behind the legendary username "Kuuhaku." <n>They view</n> the real world as just another lousy game; however, a strange e-mail challenging them to a chess match changes everything—the brother and sister are plunged into an otherworldly realm where they meet <p>Tet</p>, the <n>God</n> of Games.

The mysterious god welcomes <p>Sora</p> and <p>Shiro</p> to <n>Disboard</n>, a world where all forms of conflict—from petty squabbles to the fate of whole countries—are settled not through war, but by way of high-stake games. <n>This system</n> works thanks to a fundamental rule wherein each party must wager something they deem to be of equal value to the other party's wager. <n>In this strange</n> land where the very idea of humanity is reduced to child’s play, the indifferent genius gamer duo of <p>Sora</p> and <p>Shiro</p> have finally found a real reason to keep playing games: to unite the sixteen races of <p>Disboard</p>, defeat <p>Tet</p>, and become the gods of this new, gaming-is-everything world.
