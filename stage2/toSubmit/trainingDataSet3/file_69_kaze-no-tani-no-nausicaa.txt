A <p>millennium</p> has passed since the catastrophic nuclear war named the "Seven Days of Fire," which destroyed nearly all life on <n>Earth</n>. Humanity now lives in a constant struggle against the treacherous jungle that has evolved in response to the destruction caused by mankind. Filled with poisonous spores and enormous insects, the jungle spreads rapidly across the <n>Earth</n> and threatens to swallow the remnants of the human race.

Away from the jungle exists a peaceful farming kingdom known as the "<n>Valley</n> of the Wind," whose placement by the sea frees it from the spread of the jungle's deadly toxins. The <n>Valley</n>'s charismatic young princess, Nausicaä, finds her tranquil kingdom disturbed when an airship from the kingdom of <n>Tolmekia</n> crashes violently in the <n>Valley</n>. After Nausicaä and the citizens of the <n>Valley</n> find a sinister pulsating object in the wreckage, the <n>Valley</n> is suddenly invaded by the <p>Tolmekia</p>n military, who intend to revive a dangerous weapon from the Seven Days of Fire. Now Nausicaä must fight to stop the <p>Tolmekia</p>ns from plunging the <n>Earth</n> into a cataclysm which humanity could never survive, while also protecting the <n>Valley</n> from the encroaching forces of the toxic jungle.
