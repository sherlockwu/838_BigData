An ancient legend states that with the revival of the <p>Demon God</p>, six heroes—the <p>Brave</p>s of the Six Flowers—will be chosen by the Goddess of <n>Fate</n>, granting them power to rise up against the fiends attempting to turn the world into a living hell. <p>Adlet Mayer</p>, self-proclaimed "Strongest Man in the <n>World</n>," has arrived at the continent of <n>Piena</n> in hopes of becoming a <n>Brave</n>. Although it doesn't go as smoothly as he had planned, <p>Adlet</p> is ultimately chosen as one of the six heroes shortly after being greeted by <p>Nashetania Loei Piena</p> Augustra, <p>crown princess</p> and fellow <p>Brave</p>.

Rokka no Yuusha follows the two as they embark upon their destined journey to fight the <p>Demon God</p>, intending to meet up with their fellow heroes at a small temple outside of the Land of the Howling Demons, the fiends' domain. However, when they finally unite, seven heroes are present, and soon the others begin to suspect <p>Adlet</p> to be a fraud. Now on the run, <p>Adlet</p> must utilize his unique skill set and wit in a fight for his life to identify which member of the group is the true impostor before it's too late!
