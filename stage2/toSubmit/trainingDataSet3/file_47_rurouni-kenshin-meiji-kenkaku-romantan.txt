In the final years of the <n>Bakumatsu</n> era lived a legendary assassin known as <p>Hitokiri <p>Battousai</p></p>. Feared as a merciless killer, he was unmatched throughout the country, but mysteriously disappeared at the peak of the Japanese Revolution. It has been ten peaceful years since then, but the very mention of <p>Battousai</p> still strikes terror into the hearts of war veterans.

<n>Unbeknownst</n> to them, <p>Battousai</p> has abandoned his bloodstained lifestyle in an effort to repent for his sins, now living as <p><p>Kenshin</p> Himura</p>, a wandering swordsman with a cheerful attitude and a strong will. Vowing never to kill again, <p>Kenshin</p> dedicates himself to protecting the weak. One day, he stumbles across <p>Kaoru Kamiya</p> at her kendo dojo, which is being threatened by an impostor claiming to be <p>Battousai</p>. After receiving help from <p>Kenshin</p>, <p>Kaoru</p> allows him to stay at the dojo, and so the former assassin temporarily ceases his travels.

<p>Rurouni Kenshin</p>: <p>Meiji Kenkaku Romantan</p> tells the story of <p>Kenshin</p> as he strives to save those in need of saving. However, as enemies from both past and present begin to emerge, will the reformed killer be able to uphold his new ideals?
