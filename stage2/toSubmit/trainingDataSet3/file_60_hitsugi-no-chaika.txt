 <p>Hitsugi</p> no <n>Chaika</n> is about the quest of a pretty and charming 14-year old sorceress named <p>Chaika</p> Trabant, who carries a coffin on her back. She is surprisingly adept in casting high-precision spells, but she has no memory of her past. The only thing she knows is to gather the scattered remains of <p>Emperor Gaz</p>. <p>Toru Acura</p> is a <n>Saboteur</n> who relies on his adoptive sister <p>Akari</p> for their food. After the fall of <n>Gaz Empire</n>, he finds it difficult to land a job until he meets <p>Chaika</p> in the woods, and agrees to help her accomplish her quest along with <p>Akari</p>.

The unlikely trio sets on the journey with a clear goal in mind, unaware of the dangerous truth.
