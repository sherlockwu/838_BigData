In the backwater town of <n>Bellforest</n> lives a 14-year-old boy named <p>Renton< Thurston</p>. He desires to leave his home behind and join the mercenary group known as <p>Gekkostate</p>, hoping to find some adventure to brighten up his mundane life. However, stuck between his grandfather's insistence to become a mechanic like him and the pressure of his deceased father's legacy, the only excitement <p>Renton</p> finds is in his pastime of riding the <n>Trapar</n> wave particles that are dispersed throughout the air, an activity akin to surfing.

Everything changes when an unknown object crashes through <p>Renton</p>'s garage, discovered to be a </n>Light Finding Operation</n>—a robot capable of riding the <n>Trapar</n> waves—specifically known as the <n>Nirvash</n> typeZERO. Its pilot is a young girl named <p>Eureka</p>, a member of the <p>Gekkostate</p>, who requests a tune-up for the <n>Nirvash</n>. Their meeting sparks the beginning of <p>Renton</p>'s involvement with the <p>Gekkostate</p> as he takes off alongside <p>Eureka</p> as the co-pilot of the <n>Nirvash</n>.
