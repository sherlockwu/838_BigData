"In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost."

<n>Alchemy</n> is bound by this Law of <n>Equivalent Exchange</n>—something the young brothers <p>Edward</p> and <p>Alphonse Elric</p> only realize after attempting human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—<p>Edward</p> loses his left leg, <p>Alphonse</p> his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of <p>Edward</p>'s right arm that he is able to affix <p>Alphonse</p>'s soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives <p>Edward</p> the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.

Three years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosopher's <n>Stone</n>, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of <n>Equivalent Exchange</n>. Even with military allies <p>Colonel Roy Mustang</p>, <p>Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye</p>, and <p>Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes</p> on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's <n>Stone</n>, but their country's murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, <p>Edward</p> and <p>Alphonse</p> must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.
