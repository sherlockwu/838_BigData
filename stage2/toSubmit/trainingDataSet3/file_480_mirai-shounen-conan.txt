<n>July</n> 2008. <n>Mankind</n> was faced with the threat of <n>extinction</n>. <n>An</n> <n>ultra-magnetic</n> <n>weapon</n>, far more devastating than any nuclear weapon known, destroyed half the world in an <n>instant</n>. <n>The</n> earth's <n>crust</n> was rocked by <n>massive movements</n>, the earth was thrown off its axis, and the five continents were torn completely apart and sank deep below the sea...

<n>The</n> attempt by a number of people to flee to outer space failed. <n>Their</n> <n>spaceships</n> were forced back to the earth and vanished with their hopes shattered. <n>But</n> one of the <n>spaceships</n> narrowly escaped <n>destruction</n> and <n>crash-landed</n> on a small <n>island</n> which had miraculously survived the <n>devastation</n>. <n>The</n> crew members of the <n>spaceship</n> settled there, as if they were seeds sown on the <n>island</n>.

<n>After</n> years, a boy was born. He was a new life in the desert, a ray of light in the <n>darkness</n> of the <n>annihilated</n> earth...
