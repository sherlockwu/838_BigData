When he was a young boy, <p>Afro</p> witnessed his father be cut down in a duel at the hands of a man known only as <p>Justice</p>. After taking the life of <p>Afro</p>'s father, <p>Justice</p> cast aside his <p>Number</p> Two headband and took the Number One to claim its godly powers as his own.

Years later, having obtained the <n>Number</n> Two headband which grants him the right to challenge the <n>Number</n> One, <p>Afro</p> moves forward in his hunt for revenge on the man who murdered his father. There is just one thing that stands in his wayâ€”everyone else in the world! Though the <n>Number</n> One can only be challenged by the <n>Number</n> Two, the <n>Number</n> Two can be challenged by anyone. As his enemies gather to try and take the title of <n>Number</n> Two, <p>Afro</p> must fight through a myriad of foes and obstacles if he hopes to reach the <n>Number</n> One and claim vengeance once and for all.
