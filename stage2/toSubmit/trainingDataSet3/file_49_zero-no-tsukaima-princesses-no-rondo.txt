Following his brave sacrifice in the war against <n>Albion</n>, <p>Saito Hiraga</p> is knighted and treated as an aristocrat, something that proves difficult for <p>Louise</p> Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière. With their relationship no longer defined as the mighty <n>Void</n> mage and clueless familiar, she wonders what exactly this means for them.

While venturing to a castle, <p>Louise</p> is ambushed by a powerful mage named <p>Sheffield</p>. Battling alone, the young mage nearly faces defeat until <p>Saito</p> makes his appearance. The mystical and unknown nature of <p>Void</p> magic seems to be at work in the battle, and <p>Louise</p> begins to believe in the possibility of another <n>Void</n> user. Moreover, she realizes that <p>Saito</p>'s magical rune is fading, and so a new adventure begins as they search for the elf who revived <p>Saito</p> in the past. The relationship between former master and servant faces a new challenge as they work to restore the runes and redefine the bond which holds them together.
