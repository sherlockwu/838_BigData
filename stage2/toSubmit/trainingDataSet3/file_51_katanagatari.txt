In an Edo-era <n>Japan</n> lush with a variety of sword-fighting styles, <p>Shichika Yasuri</p> practices the most unique one: <n>Kyotouryuu</n>, a technique in which the user's own body is wielded as a blade. The enigmatic seventh head of the <n>Kyotouryuu</n> school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister <p>Nanami</p> until one dayâ€”the wildly ambitious strategist <p>Togame</p> barges into their lives.

<p>Togame</p> brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the "Deviant Blades," for the shogunate. Shichika accepts, interested in the girl herself rather than petty politics, and thus sets out on a journey. Standing in their way are the fierce wielders of these legendary weapons as well as other power-hungry entities who seek to thwart <p>Togame</p>'s objective. In order to prevail against their enemies, the duo must become an unbreakable team as they forge ahead on a path of uncertainty and peril.
