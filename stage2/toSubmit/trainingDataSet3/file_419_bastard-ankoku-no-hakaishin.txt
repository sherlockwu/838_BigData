<n>The</n> <n>characters</n> in <n>Bastard</n>!! have forsaken <n>technology</n> and have traded it in for magic and the occult <n>arts</n>. <n>The</n> story revolves around a group of five <n>magicians</n> who set out to rebuild their world after a rampaging <n>God</n> destroys it and tips it into <n>chaos</n>. <n>Driven</n> by their leader <p>Dark Schneider</p>, <p>Gara</p>, <p>Arshes Nei</p>, <p>Abigail</p> and <p>Kall Su</p> set out to conquer <n>kingdoms</n> in the hope of rebuilding them into <n>utopias</n>, with each of the <n>magicians</n> having their own personal <n>agenda</n> in doing so. <n>However</n>, <p>Dark Schneider</p>'s often <n>reckless</n> manner and short <n>temper</n> leads him to wreak <n>havoc</n> where ever he goes. He is trapped by a group of <n>clerics</n> in a baby boy, leaving the four without a <n>leader</n>.

<n>Fifteen</n> years later, the four still continue their quest but their <n>motives</n> have changed to despotic world <n>domination</n>, and it is up to <p>Dark Schneider</p> to show them the "error of their ways," when he is freed by the clerics who once imprisoned him, so that he may defend them against his former <n>comrades</n>. <n>It</n> has now become <p>Dark Schneider</p>'s responsibility to track down each one of his <n>companions</n> and set them on the right <n>path</n> again, but what seems to be the once reckless and amoral <p>Dark Schneider</p> has changed over his fifteen year <n>imprisonment</n> within the boy, <p>Luche Len Len</p>.
