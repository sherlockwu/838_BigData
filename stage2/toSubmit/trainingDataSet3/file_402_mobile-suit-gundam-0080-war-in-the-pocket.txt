<p>Alfred Izuruha</p> is a 10-year-old who lives in the neutral colony cluster of <n>Side</n> 6 and, like most boys his age, is obsessed with the war between the <n>Earth Federation</n> and the <n>Principality of Zeon</n>. <n>Unbeknownst</n> to him, Al's next-door neighbor, <p>Christina</p>, is the test pilot of a prototype Gundam being developed in secret by the <n>Earth Federation</n> in the colony. A <n>Zeon Special Forces</n> team is assembled and tasked with infiltrating the colony in order to either steal or destroy it.

<n>When</n> a skirmish breaks out between the <n>Federation</n> and infiltrating <n>Zeon forces</n>, the fascinated <p>Alfred</p> stumbles upon a <n>Zaku mobile</n> suit that has been shot down, piloted by <n>Zeon</n> rookie <n>Bernard "Bernie"</n> <n>Wiseman</n>. <n>After</n> this encounter, the two start a mutual friendship, so <p>Alfred</p> can learn more about the war that interests him so much, and <p>Bernie</p> can acquire inside information about the colony to aid his team's mission.
