In a world similar to the European <n>Middle</n> Ages, the feared yet revered <p>Holy Knights</p> of <n>Britannia</n> use immensely powerful magic to protect the region of <n>Britannia</n> and its kingdoms. However, a small subset of the <p>Knights</p> supposedly betrayed their homeland and turned their blades against their comrades in an attempt to overthrow the ruler of <n>Liones</n>. They were defeated by the <p>Holy Knights</p>, but rumors continued to persist that these legendary knights, called the "Seven Deadly Sins," were still alive. Ten years later, the <p>Holy Knights</p> themselves staged a coup d’état, and thus became the new, tyrannical rulers of the <n>Kingdom</n> of <p>Liones</p>.

Based on the best-selling manga series of the same name, <p>Nanatsu</p> no <p>Taizai</p> follows the adventures of <p>Elizabeth</p>, the third princess of the <n>Kingdom</n> of <n>Liones</n>, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take back her kingdom from the <p>Holy Knights</p>, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.
