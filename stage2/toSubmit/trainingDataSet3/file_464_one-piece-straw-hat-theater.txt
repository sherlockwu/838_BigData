The third short <n>investigates</n> the hypothetical situation of "if the <n>Straw Hat Pirates</n> were <p>Obahan</p>, who would be the <n>strongest</n>?" <n>The</n> fourth short is about the <n>bosses</n> of the <p>Luffione</p>, <p>Zorocia</p>, and <p>Sanjino</p> families fighting for control. <n>In</n> the fifth short, all of the <n>Straw Hats</n> are carefree <n>monsters</n>.
