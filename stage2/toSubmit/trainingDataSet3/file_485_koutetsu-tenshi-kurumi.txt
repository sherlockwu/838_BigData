<n>During</n> <n>Japan</n>'s <n>Taisho Era</n> (1912-1926), a <n>scientist</n> named <p>Ayanokoji</p> developed the <n>Steel Angel</n> - an artificial <n>humanoid</n> with superhuman physical <n>abilities</n>. While the <n>Imperial Army</n> wanted to use the <n>Steel Angel</n> as a new means of <n>modern warfare</n>, <p>Ayanokoji</p> wanted his <n>creation</n> to be a new step in the future of <n>mankind</n>. <n>Thus</n>, he defied <n>orders</n> from the <n>Army</n> and secretly made the <n>Steel Angel</n> codenamed "<p>Kurumi</p>". <n>Then</n> one day, a young boy named <p>Nakahito Kagura</p> snuck into <p>Ayanokoji</p>'s <n>house</n> as a dare by his <n>friends</n> and stumbled upon <p>Kurumi</p>'s lifeless body. <n>A</n> sudden attack by the <n>Imperial Army</n> shook the <n>house</n>, causing <p>Kurumi</p> to fall on <n>Nakahito</n>. <n>At</n> that moment, their <n>lips</n> met, and <p>Kurumi</p> woke up from "the kiss that started a <n>miracle</n>".
