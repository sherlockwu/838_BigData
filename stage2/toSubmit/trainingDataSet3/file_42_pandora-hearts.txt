To young <p>Oz Vessalius</p>, heir to the <n>Vessalius Duke House</n>, the perilous world called the <n>Abyss</n> is nothing more than a folktale used to scare misbehaving children. However, when <p>Oz</p>'s coming-of-age ceremony is interrupted by the malicious <p>Baskerville Clan</p> intent on banishing him into the depths of the <p>Abyss</p>, the <n>Vessalius</n> heir realizes that his peaceful life of luxury is at its end. Now, he must confront the world of the <p>Abyss</p> and its dwellers, the monstrous "<p>Chain</p>s," which are both not quite as fake as he once believed.

Based on the supernatural fantasy manga of the same name, <n>Pandora Hearts</n> tells the story of fifteen-year-old <p>Oz</p>'s journey to discover the meaning behind the strange events that have overtaken his life. Assisted by a mysterious <p>Chain</p> named <p>Alice</p>, whose nickname is "<n>Bloodstained Black Rabbit</n>," and members of a clandestine organization known as "<p>Pandora</p>," <p>Oz</p> begins to realize his existence may have more meaning than he could have ever imagined.
