<p>Gol D. Roger</p> was known as the "<n>Pirate King</n>," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the <n>Grand Line</n>. The capture and death of <p>Roger</p> by the <n>World Government</n> brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the <n>Grand Age</n> of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the <n>Pirate King</n>.

Enter <p>Monkey D. Luffy</p>, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, <p>Luffy</p>’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, <p>Luffy</p> and his crew travel across the <n>Grand Line</n>, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.
