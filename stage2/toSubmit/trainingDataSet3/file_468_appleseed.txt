<n>Appleseed</n> takes place in the aftermath of <n>World War III</n>, where the <n>General Management Control Office</n> has constructed the experimental city known as <n>Olympus</n>. <n>Built</n> to be a <n>paradise</n> on <n>Earth</n>, <n>Olympus</n> is inhabited by <n>humans</n>, <n>cyborgs</n>, and <n>bioroids</n> (genetically engineered humans designed for increased physical <n>capabilities</n> and decreased emotional capabilities). <n>Bioroids</n> run and control all of the administrative functions of <n>Olympus</n>, ensuring that the city remains the <n>utopian</n> society it was meant to be for all of its <n>citizens</n>. <n>But</n> for some people living in <n>Utopia</n>, the city has become less of a home and more of a <n>cage</n>.

<n>Police officer</n> <p>Calon Mautholos</p> has grown to despise <n>Olympus</n> following his wife's <n>suicide</n>, blaming her death on the lack of creative <n>freedom</n> caused by the <n>rules</n> binding the <n>citizens</n> of the city. <n>As</n> his hatred for the city grows, <p>Calon</p> conspires with the <n>terrorist</n> <p>A.J. Sebastian</p> to destroy the <n>Legislature</n> of the <n>Central Management Bureau</n> to send the rules of <n>Olympus</n> that killed his wife tumbling down. <n>But</n> when <p>Calon</p> discovers it is not political <n>malcontent</n>, but rather hatred for bioroids that motives <n>Sebastian</n>, <p>Calon</p> turns renegade and gains the attention of city <n>officials</n>. <p>Deunan Knute</p> and her partner <n>Briareos</n> of the <n>ESWAT</n> counter-terrorism unit are dispatched to hunt down and stop <p>Calon</p> and <p>Sebastian</p>... by any means necessary!
