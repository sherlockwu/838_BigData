Every 30 years, a new princess is chosen from the Hime family to serve the Hayagami. The time has come again, but over these past years, records state not a single female has been born, save for one, the 15-year-old Arata. The only problem is, <p>Arata</p> is actually a male! Forced to disguise himself and take the place of the princess <n>candidate until</n> a formal one can be found, he attends the festival only to witness the current princess, <p>Kokuri-hime</p>, murdered, and his own life is forfeit as well, <n>by the hands</n> of the princess' personal guard, the 12 Shinshou. As he runs for his life, <p>Kannagi</p> of the 12 convinces everyone that Arata is the one who has murdered the <n>princess instead</n>, and now everyone in the <n>Imperial Court</n> is after his head!
