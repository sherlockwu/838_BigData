<n>Most people</n> think being born into a <n>noble family</n> means a life of comfort and wealth. <n>That couldn't</n> be further from the truth for <p>Shuurei Kou</p>. <n>Despite the</n> Kou family being an old and <n>important bloodline</n>, they've fallen on hard times. <n>Shuurei's father<n> works as an archivist in the <n>Imperial library</n>, which is a prestigious position, but unfortunately not one that pays much. To put food on the table, Shuurei works odd jobs such as teaching young children or playing live music in a restaurant―and even then, it's barely enough.

Then, one day, a court advisor makes <n>Shuurei an</n> offer. If she becomes the concubine of the new, but lazy, emperor and teaches him how to become a good ruler, then she will receive 500 pieces of gold. Never one to turn down good money, <n>Shuurei accepts</n> the proposition. After all, the new emperor only <n>prefers men</n> so her virtue is safe… or so she thinks.

The more time she spends in the palace, the more her old dream of becoming a court official is reignited. There's only one problem: she's a woman and women do not become government officials. <p>Shuurei</p> may be able to turn the emperor into a good ruler, but will it be at the expense of her own aspirations?
