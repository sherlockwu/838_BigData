Most people think that ninjas are a thing of the past, but Rekka Hanabishi wishes otherwise. Although he comes <n>from a family</n> that makes fireworks, he likes to think of himself as a self-styled, modern-day ninja. Sounds like fun, right? Maybe not. <p>Rekka</p> ends up in lots of fights because he once made the bold announcement that if someone can defeat him, he will become their servant.

Then one day, <p>Rekka</p> meets <p>Yanagi Sakoshita</p>, a <n>gentle girl</n> with the ability to heal any wound or injury. Their meeting sets off a chain of events, which culminate into a shocking discovery. <p>Rekka</p> is the last surviving member of a <n>legendary ninja</n> clan that was wiped out centuries ago. Even more <n>astonishing than</n> being an actual ninja, he also wields the power to control fire. What <n>does this</n> mean for Rekka? Who are these strange <n>people after</n> him and Yanagi? Find out in Rekka no Honoo!
