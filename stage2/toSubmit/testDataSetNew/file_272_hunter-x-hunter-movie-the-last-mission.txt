<p>Nen</p>: the hidden source of energy and potential that runs through everyone, and gives those that master it a source of great power. Inside Nen is the potential for limitless light and limitless darkness. The Hunter Association has arisen to control access to it. Hunters come in many shapes and forms, and with many different appetites - but all of them have learned to master Nen, and use it to chase wealth, power, and their dreams.

The greatest and most powerful Hunter is Isaac Netero, chairman of the Hunter Association. Decades ago he sealed away <n>Jed</n>, a Hunter who had mastered the use of On, the dark "shadow" of Nen. Now On users have <n>reappeared at</n> the Heaven's Arena "Battle Olympia" tournament. For Netero, this is the last mission: to protect the <n>Association and</n> the world from a threat driven by hatred <n>and the thirst</n> for revenge. And he's going to need all the help he can get in order to succeed.
