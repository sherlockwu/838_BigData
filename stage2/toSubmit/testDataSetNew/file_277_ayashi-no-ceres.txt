<p>Ceres</p> was a tennyo (Celestial maiden) who came down from the heavens to bathe in a stream. She hung her hagoromo (robe) on a tree nearby, <n>which was</n> her key to returning to the heavens. But the robe was <n>stolen and</n> the man who had stolen it forced her <n>to become his</n> wife, thus producing a family full of human and tennyo blood mixed.

Now, in modern day time, <p>Aya Mikage</p> is a descendent of Ceres, and has quite an amount of tennyo blood. On her 16th birthday, she and her twin brother, <p>Aki</p>, are thrown a party. At the "party," Aya's grandpa plans to kill her, <n>for she</n> has tennyo powers unlike the rest of the family, and can actually become Ceres herself and destroy the Mikage family. <p>Aya</p>, however, can switch back, so this <n>transformation happens</n> quite frequently.

With protector Yuuhi by her side, <n>it is up</n> to Aya to control Ceres and keep her from coming back, but her relationship with an ex-worker for her evil grandpa <n>may be a</n> distraction.
