Wizard <p>Negi Springfield</p> may be a boy, but he has a man-sized job to do! Fresh from the <n>Academy of Magic</n>, Negi continues his training as an instructor at Mahora Academy in <n>Japan</n>. But before he can get <n>his Masters</n> in magic, the <n>31 schoolgirls</n> of Class 3-A are gonna keep him up all night cramming for a final exam in will power. <n>Temptation aside</n>, Negi has more on his syllabus than flirting and spells.
