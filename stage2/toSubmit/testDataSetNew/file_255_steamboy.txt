<p>Ray</p> is a young wunderkind inventor living in Victorian England. His <n>life is</n> turned upside down when he receives a special package hailing from the <n>United States</n>, sent by his grandfather, <p>Lloyd Steam</p>. The package contains a device called a Steam Ball, a<n> device so</n> powerful that it can drive any machine that <n>requires steam</n> with a nearly limitless amount of energy.

<p>Ray</p> is instructed to not let the Steam Ball fall into the wrong hands, which include the mighty <n>O'Hara Foundation</n>, who desperately <n>want to bring</n> the Steam Ball back into their control so they <n>can achieve</n> their less than noble goals.

He will need to use every bit of <n>his brilliance</n> in order to dodge the <n>countless goons</n> that are sent to snatch the device from him. It will be a <n>battle between</n> good and evil, a battle for redemption, a battle for the future!
